### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [StÃ©phane](github.com/sorieux). I'm a Data Engineer currently shaping the data landscape at a French bank. 

While my day-to-day involves steering intricate data projects, I cherish every opportunity to dive deep into coding. Python is my go-to these days, but I occasionally dabble in frontend and Java as well.


Should you wish to discuss, collaborate, or simply chat, please DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephane-orieux/) ðŸ“¬

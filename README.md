### Hi I'm [Stéphane](github.com/sorieux) 👋

I'm Stéphane, a data engineer currently working for a French bank.

When I'm not diving deep into data projects, I love coding away! Python is my go-to these days, but I also dabble in frontend stuff and some Java ☕️.

If you want to chat or collaborate, the best way to reach me is to DM me on [LinkedIn](your_linkedin_profile_url)! 📬
